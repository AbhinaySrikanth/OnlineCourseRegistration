## Online Course Registration Platform (Prototype)

This repository contains a simple prototype for an online course registration platform. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5, with fonts sourced from Google Fonts and images from Pixabay.

## Overview

This project is a static website that allows users to browse a selection of online courses. When a user clicks "Register" on any course, they are redirected to a related YouTube playlist for that course. The site is intended as a learning exercise to demonstrate page redirection, website layout, and styling with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
